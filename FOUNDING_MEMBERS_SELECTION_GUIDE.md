# Founding Members Selection Guide

**Goal:** Identify 5–10 humans who will give you honest signal for Season 01.

**Not a goal:** Scale, virality, perfect diversity, or "impressive" members.

## The 5 Archetypes (Mix & Match)

### A. The "Honest Friend" (Need: 1–2)

**Profile:**
- Will actually tell you "This part was confusing" or "I got bored here"
- Doesn't sugar-coat, but isn't cruel
- Values directness over politeness when giving feedback
- You trust them to say the hard thing

**Why you need them:**
- You'll get real signal, not just "this is great!"
- They'll tell you what others are thinking but not saying
- Critical for identifying actual blockers

**How to identify:**
- Think: "Who has given me brutally honest feedback before?"
- Who would say "I don't get it" instead of staying quiet?
- Who have you thanked in the past for "telling it like it is"?

**Why you need them:**

**Profile:**

- Genuinely curious about learning/productivity/chess
- Might invite more people if they authentically like it
- Not a "big influencer" – just socially active

**Why you need them:**
- *Only* if they fit the beginner profile AND have an audience
- Potential amplification for Season 02 if Season 01 goes well
- Brings diverse perspectives from their network

**How to identify:**
- Think: "Who has 500–5k followers and talks about learning/hobbies?"
- Who runs a small community that might overlap with Chessio?

1. ______________________ (Why: _________________________________)

## People to AVOID (Season 01)

❌ **The Expert (2200+ rated)**
- Will dominate conversations with advanced concepts
- Makes beginners feel inadequate
- Not your target user – save for "advanced track" later

❌ **The Chronic Ghoster**
- Always says "yes, yes, I'll join" then disappears
- You'll waste energy following up
- Better to have 5 committed than 10 half-in

❌ **The Overwhelmed Parent/Founder**
- Extremely busy and stressed
- Will feel guilty for not participating
- You'll feel bad "bothering" them
- Invite them to Season 02 when life calms down

❌ **The "Let Me Tell You Why This Won't Work" Guy**
- Immediately suggests massive pivots
- Wants to "help you build features" instead of testing what exists
- You need testers, not co-founders

❌ **The Unintentional Discourager**
- Says things like "chess is easy, just don't blunder"
- Makes beginners feel dumb without meaning to
- Vibe killer for your calm club

## Pre-Invite Checklist (Before Jan 2)

### Week of Dec 9-15: Discord Setup Week

- [ ] Create Discord server (30 min, follow DISCORD_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Post welcome message in #welcome-start-here
- [ ] Generate invite link (20 max uses, no expiration)
- [ ] Test: Can you join from a different account? Does it look good?

### Week of Dec 16-22: Self-Playthrough Week

**Create a fresh Chessio account (not your admin account):**
- [ ] Complete Week 1 mission as if you're a member
- [ ] Note any friction points in a simple doc:
  ```
  Pre-Season Notes (Dec 2024)
  
  - Task 3 in intro-rook: The valid moves aren't obvious
  - Hint button on concept-piece-value: Just repeats instruction
  - XP Bar: Didn't realize I was close to leveling up
  ```
- [ ] Fix 1-2 critical issues if they're quick (< 30 min total)
- [ ] Add rest to Sprint 05 backlog, don't obsess

**Complete Week 2 mission:**
- [ ] Does the jump from Week 1 → Week 2 feel natural?
- [ ] Note any issues

**Try 1-2 Week 3 lessons:**
- [ ] Is the tactical content clear for beginners?
- [ ] Note any issues

**Don't do this:**
- ❌ Refactor the entire lesson system
- ❌ Redesign the UI
- ❌ Add new features
- ❌ Spend more than 2-3 hours total on this

**Goal:** Catch obvious blockers, not achieve perfection.

### Week of Dec 23-29: Holiday Break

- [ ] Don't think about Chessio
- [ ] Come back fresh for launch prep

### Week of Dec 30 - Jan 1: Final Prep Week

- [ ] Write a personal note for each invite explaining why you picked them
- [ ] Prepare Discord posts (Season announcement + Week 1 mission)
- [ ] Clear your calendar for Jan 6-9 (first few days need attention)

### Thursday, Jan 2: SEND INVITES

- [ ] Morning: Post Season announcement in Discord #announcements
- [ ] Morning: Post Week 1 mission in Discord #announcements

## What to Do If You Get "No" or Ghost

**Expected and okay:**
- Aim for 10 invites → expect 5-7 to join → expect 3-5 to stay active throughout
- If 5 people complete all 4 weeks, that's a massive win

**If someone says no:**
- Response: "No worries at all! I'll let you know when Season 02 launches if you want to join then."
- Add them to "Season 02 potential members" list

**If someone ghosts (doesn't respond):**
- Wait 48 hours
- Send one gentle follow-up: "Hey! Just checking if you got my message about Chessio. No pressure either way!"
- If still no response → move on, don't take it personally

**If someone joins but doesn't start:**
- Wait until Wednesday (2 days after launch)
- Send private DM: "Hey! Noticed you joined Discord but haven't started the mission yet. Any blockers? Totally fine if timing doesn't work!"
- If they say timing's bad → "No problem, maybe Season 02?"

---

## Mental Framework: Quality > Quantity

**5 committed members who:**
- Complete all missions
- Give honest feedback
- Feel genuinely helped

**Is infinitely more valuable than:**

**20 members who:**
- Lurk silently
- Drop off by Week 2
- Give "nice job!" feedback with no substance

**You're looking for signal, not scale.**

---

## Final Reminders

1. **Pick people you'd genuinely enjoy spending 4 weeks learning alongside.**
   - If the thought of checking Discord every day to see their messages feels fun → good pick.
   - If it feels like an obligation → probably not the right person for Season 01.

2. **It's okay if your list isn't "impressive."**
   - You don't need a chess GM, a YC founder, or a Twitter influencer.
   - You need honest humans who match your target user profile.

3. **You can always add more people mid-season.**
   - Week 2-3 you might think "oh, [person] would be perfect for this."
   - Just tell them: "Join mid-season, catch up at your own pace, Season runs until Feb 2."

4. **Trust your gut.**
   - If someone feels like the "right" person but doesn't fit a clean archetype → invite them.
   - If someone looks perfect on paper but something feels off → skip them.

## Next Action (Right Now)

1. **Open a blank note/doc**
2. **Title it:** "Season 01 Founding Members - Draft List"
3. **Set a 20-minute timer**
4. **Write 10 names as fast as you can** (no filtering yet)
5. **Then review and categorize** using the archetypes above
6. **Pick your top 5-7** (high confidence)
7. **Add 2-3 backups** (medium confidence)
8. **Close the doc and don't overthink it**

You have until January 2 to finalize. That's 4 weeks. Don't spend more than 1 hour total thinking about this.

**The list will never be perfect. Good enough is the goal.** 🥋♟️
