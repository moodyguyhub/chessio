## 1. Season 01 Announcement (for Alpha Testers)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🥋 Welcome to Chessio International Club
Founding Season 01
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hey everyone,

You're part of the founding group for something new: a calm, structured way to learn chess with other serious beginners.

This is Season 01 – a 4-week experiment to see if this format works.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT IS SEASON 01?

For the next 4 weeks, you'll get:
• Weekly missions (2–3 short sessions per week)
• Clear lessons & puzzles in the Chessio app
• A small community space to share positions and insights
• No pressure, no streak shaming, just steady progress

Goal: Take you from Novice → Knight/Bishop level
Time: ~20–30 minutes per session, 2–3x per week

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📅 THE 4 WEEKS

Week 1: Safety & Basic Habits
→ Get comfortable with the app, finish Level 0, reach Pawn

Week 2: Stop Hanging Pieces  
→ Learn what "hanging" means, start spotting vulnerabilities

Week 3: Tactics Starter Pack
→ Forks, pins, and puzzle practice

Week 4: Basic Checkmates & Reflection
→ Finish strong, reach Knight or Bishop, reflect on progress

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 WHAT I'M ASKING FROM YOU

1. Try the weekly missions (doesn't have to be perfect)
2. Share at least 1 position or insight per week here
3. Send feedback when something confuses or delights you
4. Be honest about what works and what doesn't

This is a pilot. Your input shapes what Season 02 looks like.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 LET'S START

Week 1 mission coming tomorrow.

For now: log into Chessio, check out the dashboard, and explore a bit. If you hit any issues, let me know.

Welcome to the club. 🥋♟️

## 2. Week 1 Mission (Copy-Paste for Chat)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Week 1 Mission – "Safety & Basic Habits"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Welcome to Week 1, everyone.

This week is about getting comfortable with Chessio and building safe opening habits.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 YOUR MISSION THIS WEEK

In the Chessio app:

1. Complete all Level 0 lessons
   (piece moves, basic rules, check vs checkmate)

2. Start Level 1:
   • "Safe Development" intro
   • "Piece Values" recap

Goal: Reach Pawn level (75 XP) or get close

Time: 2–3 sessions of 20–30 minutes each

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 SHARE WITH THE GROUP

Once you've done a few lessons, share:

"One thing I *thought* I knew but realized I didn't"

Examples:
• "I didn't know stalemate was a draw"
• "I didn't realize you can't castle through check"
• "I thought knights could move 2 squares in any direction"

This helps everyone learn from each other's "aha" moments.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ QUESTIONS?

Just ask here. No question is too basic – that's exactly what we're here for.

Let's build some solid foundations. 🥋♟️
```

## 3. Week 2 Mission

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Week 2 Mission – "Stop Hanging Pieces"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Week 2 is all about piece safety.

Most beginner games are decided by who gives away free material first. Let's fix that.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 YOUR MISSION THIS WEEK

In Chessio:

1. Complete these Level 1 lessons:
   • "Hanging Pieces" (what it means + how to spot them)
   • "Center Control" (why the center matters)

2. Start your first puzzle set:
   • "Level 1: Safety and Checks"

Goal: Push toward ~140–160 XP total

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 SHARE WITH THE GROUP

Post:
• One game (or position) where you hung a piece in the past
• What you'd do differently now

Bonus challenge:
• For the next week, before every move, ask yourself:
  "Is anything of mine hanging?"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 TIP

"Hanging" just means a piece is undefended and can be taken for free. The habit of checking "is anything hanging?" before you move is worth 200+ rating points by itself.

Let's build that habit. 🥋♟️
```

## 4. Week 3 Mission

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Week 3 Mission – "Tactics Starter Pack"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Welcome to tactics week.

This is where chess gets fun. You'll learn short patterns that win material or deliver checkmate.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 YOUR MISSION THIS WEEK

In Chessio:

1. Complete Level 2 lessons:
   • "Tactics Overview" (what tactics are)
   • "Forks" (one piece attacks two)
   • "Pins" (a piece can't move without losing something valuable)

2. Work through these puzzle sets:
   • "Forks" puzzle pack
   • "Pins" puzzle pack

Goal: Many of you will hit Knight level this week

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 SHARE WITH THE GROUP

Post any position where you:
• Missed a fork or pin in your own games
• Finally spotted one and it felt great

Remember: It's *normal* to miss these at first. The whole point of training is to wire these patterns into your brain so they become automatic.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 TACTIC OF THE WEEK

[You can post a simple fork and pin position here for discussion]

Happy hunting. 🥋♟️

## 5. Week 4 Mission & Season Wrap

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Week 4 Mission – "Basic Checkmates & Season Finish"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Final week of Season 01.

This week is about finishing strong and learning how to convert advantages into checkmates.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 YOUR MISSION THIS WEEK

In Chessio:

1. Complete:
   • "Basic Mates" lesson (ladder mate, back rank mate)

2. Work through:
   • "Mate in One" puzzle pack
   • Any puzzle sets you skipped earlier

Goal: 
• Many of you will be solidly in Knight territory
• Some will hit Bishop (375+ XP)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 SEASON 01 REFLECTION

Share with the group:

"Before Chessio Season 01, I used to blunder by ___.
Now I'm more aware of ___."

Examples:
• "I used to hang pieces every game. Now I check before I move."
• "I used to panic in the opening. Now I develop calmly."
• "I used to resign when down material. Now I look for tactics."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎓 WHAT'S NEXT

After Week 4:
• I'll share Season 01 results and learnings
• You'll get to give feedback on what worked / didn't work
• We'll discuss what Season 02 should look like

Thank you for being part of this founding group.

You helped shape what the Chessio International Club becomes.

Let's finish strong. 🥋♟️
