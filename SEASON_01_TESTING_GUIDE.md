# Season 01 Testing Guide

**Goal:** Validate the complete Season 01 experience before sending real invites.

**Time needed:** 2-3 hours total (can split across multiple sessions)

---

## Phase 1: Discord Server Setup Test (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Test Discord Server

Follow `DISCORD_SETUP_GUIDE.md` exactly:

1. **Create server:** "Chessio International Club – Founding Season 01 [TEST]"
2. **Create 5 channels:**
   - #welcome-start-here
   - #announcements
   - #club-chat
   - #positions-and-puzzles
   - #wins-and-reflections
3. **Post all messages:**
   - Welcome message in #welcome-start-here
   - Season announcement in #announcements
   - Week 1 mission in #announcements
   - First chat nudge in #club-chat

### Step 2: Validate Setup

**Check:**
- [ ] Can you read all channels clearly?
- [ ] Are messages formatted correctly (no broken links)?
- [ ] Do channel descriptions make sense?
- [ ] Does the tone feel calm and welcoming?

**Test with a friend (optional):**
- Send test invite to 1 trusted person
- Ask: "Does this feel approachable? Anything confusing?"
- Don't explain anything – let them experience it fresh

### Step 3: Document Issues

Create a note: `discord-test-notes.md`

```
Discord Setup Test - [Date]

What worked:
- [e.g., "Welcome message tone feels perfect"]
- [e.g., "Channel structure is clear"]

What to fix:
- [e.g., "Discord invite link in welcome message doesn't work"]
- [e.g., "Week 1 mission text formatting broken"]

Tiny tweaks for real launch:
- [e.g., "Maybe bold the 'Time commitment' section"]
```

---

## Phase 2: App Experience Test (60-90 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Fresh Test Account

**Critical:** Don't use your admin/founder account. You need beginner perspective.

1. Open Chessio in incognito/private browser
2. Register with a fresh email (use + trick: `youremail+test@gmail.com`)
3. Don't skip any onboarding steps

**Take notes as you go:**
- First impression: confusing or welcoming?
- Is it obvious where to start?
- Does the UI feel calm or overwhelming?

### Step 2: Complete Week 1 Mission

Follow the exact mission from `SEASON_01_MESSAGES.md`:

**Mission:**
1. Complete all Level 0 lessons
2. Start Level 1: "Safe Development" intro + "Piece Values" recap
3. Goal: Reach Pawn level (75 XP) or get close

**While doing this, note:**

**Friction points:**
- [ ] Where did you get confused?
- [ ] Which instructions were unclear?
- [ ] Did any tasks feel broken or buggy?
- [ ] Did hints actually help?
- [ ] Was failure feedback helpful or frustrating?

**Timing:**
- [ ] How long did it actually take? (Mission says 20-30 min)
- [ ] Could a true beginner finish in that time?

**Engagement:**
- [ ] Did you feel motivated to keep going?
- [ ] Was XP progression clear?
- [ ] Did leveling up feel rewarding?

### Step 3: Complete Week 2 Mission (Optional)

If you have time, follow Week 2 mission:

**Mission:**
1. concept-hanging-pieces
2. concept-center-control
3. First puzzle set

**Check:**
- [ ] Is the difficulty jump from Week 1 → Week 2 reasonable?
- [ ] Do tactics make sense for beginners?
- [ ] Are puzzles too easy/hard?

### Step 4: Try Week 3 Content (Spot Check)

Don't complete everything – just try 1-2 lessons:

**Check:**
- [ ] Does tactical content (forks, pins) have clear examples?
- [ ] Is notation explained when used?
- [ ] Do puzzles feel solvable?

---

## Phase 3: End-to-End Journey Test (30 minutes)

### Simulate a Member's Week 1 Experience

Pretend you just joined the club. Walk through the full flow:

**Monday morning (Launch Day):**
1. Check Discord #announcements
2. Read Season announcement + Week 1 mission
3. Go to Chessio app
4. Start Week 1 mission

**During the week:**
1. Complete a few lessons (don't do it all at once)
2. Come back to Discord
3. Would you naturally post in #wins-and-reflections?
4. Would you ask questions in #club-chat?

**Wednesday (Mid-week check):**
1. Read the check-in post in #club-chat
2. Would you reply with an emoji?
3. Does it feel like gentle accountability or pressure?

**Sunday (Week end):**
1. Have you finished the mission?
2. If not, do you feel guilty or fine?
3. Does the messaging support "it's okay if you didn't finish"?

### Document the Experience

```
End-to-End Journey Test - [Date]

Best moments:
- [e.g., "Leveling up to Pawn felt great"]
- [e.g., "Discord vibe is perfect – no pressure"]

Friction points:
- [e.g., "Didn't know if I should post before finishing mission"]
- [e.g., "Week 1 took 45 min, not 20-30"]

Suggestions:
- [e.g., "Add '15 min break' reminder between lessons"]
- [e.g., "Clarify: you can post anytime, don't wait"]
```

---

## Phase 4: Founding Member Perspective Test (Optional)

### Invite 1-2 Beta Testers (Not Your Final Cohort)

Pick people who:
- Match your target user (true beginner or returning adult)
- Will give brutal honest feedback
- Understand this is a pre-launch test

**Send them:**
```
Hey [Name],

I'm doing a final test run of Chessio + the club structure before launching in January.

Would you be willing to:
1. Join a test Discord server
2. Try Week 1 mission in the app (~30 min)
3. Give me 100% honest feedback on what's confusing

This is NOT the real Season 01 – just a test.
Your feedback helps me fix issues before real launch.

Interested? Takes ~1 hour total this week.
```

**What to watch:**
- Where do they get stuck without asking you?
- What do they assume that's wrong?
- What do they love?
- What makes them want to quit?

**Don't help them unless they're completely blocked.**  
Their confusion = your most valuable data.

---

## Phase 5: Founder Operating System Test (15 minutes)

### Simulate Your Daily/Weekly Routine

**Monday morning:**
- [ ] Can you post the weekly mission in < 10 minutes?
- [ ] Is the content copy-paste ready or do you need to edit?

**Daily check (5 min):**
- [ ] Open Discord, scan #club-chat and #wins-and-reflections
- [ ] React with 1-2 emojis
- [ ] Does this feel manageable or stressful?

**Mid-week check (5 min):**
- [ ] Post the check-in template
- [ ] Does it feel natural or forced?

**Sunday wrap (15 min):**
- [ ] Write a one-paragraph summary of the (test) week
- [ ] Is the template helpful or annoying?

**Check your energy:**
- Does 45-60 min/week feel sustainable?
- Would you want to do this for 4 weeks?
- What would make it easier?

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Week 1 Mission Takes 45+ Minutes

**Fix options:**
1. Adjust messaging: "Week 1 mission: 30-45 min (2-3 sessions)"
2. Remove one lesson from Week 1
3. Keep as-is but warn: "Some people finish in 20 min, others take 45"

### Issue: Discord Feels Empty/Quiet

**This is normal for 5-10 people.** Don't panic.

**Fix:**
- Post more "permission to participate" messages
- Share your own positions/puzzles first
- Ask specific questions: "What was one thing you learned today?"

### Issue: Members Don't Know When to Post

**Fix:**
- Add to welcome message: "Feel free to post anytime – before, during, or after lessons"
- Model it yourself: Post as you go, not just after completing missions

### Issue: Hints in App Aren't Helpful

**Fix for Sprint 05:**
- Note which tasks have bad hints
- Rewrite them based on actual confusion
- Consider visual hints (highlight squares)

### Issue: You Feel Overwhelmed by Daily Checks

**Fix:**
- Set Discord to "Do Not Disturb" except during your scheduled check time
- Remove Discord from phone (desktop only)
- Remind yourself: "5 min, that's it"

## Testing Checklist Summary

Before January 2, complete:

### Must Do:
- [ ] Set up test Discord server
- [ ] Post all Season 01 messages
- [ ] Create fresh Chessio account
- [ ] Complete Week 1 mission as a member
- [ ] Note 3-5 friction points
- [ ] Fix critical blockers (< 30 min each)

---

## What NOT to Test

**Don't obsess over:**
- Perfect copy (good enough is fine)
- Visual polish (already done in v1.3-alpha)
- Edge cases (wait for real users to hit them)
- Scale (you're testing for 5-10 people, not 1000)

**Don't add features based on testing.**  
Only fix things that would genuinely block a beginner.

---

## After Testing: What to Do

### 1. Fix Critical Blockers Only

**Critical = member can't progress:**
- Broken task logic
- Confusing instructions that cause rage-quit
- Technical bugs that block lesson completion

**Time limit: 30 min per fix.**  
If it takes longer → log to Sprint 05 and launch anyway.

### 2. Log Everything Else

Create `pre-season-fixes-optional.md`:

```
Pre-Season Fixes (Optional)

Could fix before Jan 6:
- [ ] Rewrite hint for Task 3 in intro-rook (5 min)
- [ ] Bold the "Time commitment" in welcome message (2 min)

Should wait for Sprint 05:
- [ ] Add visual hints to tactical puzzles
- [ ] Improve XP bar visibility
- [ ] Add "Position of the Week" feature

Feedback from beta testers:
- [Quote their exact words]
```

### 3. Update Discord Posts if Needed

If you found better wording during testing:
- Update your message templates
- Keep it simple – don't rewrite everything

### 4. Finalize Founding Member List

After testing, you'll know:
- How long missions actually take (adjust expectations)
- What confusion to warn people about
- What to celebrate when people succeed

Use this to customize your invites.

## Testing Success Criteria

**Testing is successful if:**
- ✅ You completed Week 1 mission without major blockers
- ✅ Discord structure feels clear and welcoming
- ✅ You identified 3-5 friction points to log
- ✅ You feel confident sending invites on Jan 2
- ✅ You know the routine is sustainable (45-60 min/week)

**Testing is NOT about:**
- ❌ Achieving perfection
- ❌ Fixing every tiny issue
- ❌ Adding new features
- ❌ Comparing to Duolingo/Chess.com

**Season 01 is an experiment. Tests help you reduce obvious friction, not eliminate all risk.**

---

## Quick Start (If You Only Have 1 Hour)

**Priority testing path:**

1. **Set up Discord test server** (15 min)
   - Create channels
   - Post welcome + Season announcement + Week 1 mission
   - Check: does it feel welcoming?

2. **Try Week 1 mission as fresh user** (30 min)
   - New account in incognito
   - Complete lessons
   - Note: where did you get confused?

3. **Identify top 3 issues** (10 min)
   - What MUST be fixed?
   - What can wait?

4. **Fix critical blockers or log them** (5 min)
   - < 30 min fixes → do now
   - Longer fixes → Sprint 05

**Done. You're ready to launch.**

---

## Final Note

**Perfect testing is the enemy of launching.**

You've already built:
- A working product
- Complete documentation
- Clear structure

Testing helps you catch obvious issues, not guarantee perfection.

**Aim for:** "I'm 80% confident this won't blow up"  
**Not:** "I'm 100% certain every member will have a flawless experience"

Season 01 is your real test. These 5-10 founding members WILL find issues you missed. That's the point.

**Test enough to feel confident. Then launch.** 🥋♟️
