## What's NOT Complete (Intentionally)

### ⏸️ Sprint 05 (Alpha Fix & Polish)

### ⏸️ Season 02
- **Timing:** TBD (earliest: March 2025)
- **Structure:** Will adjust based on Season 01 learnings
- **Cohort:** Might invite founding members + their +1s

### ⏸️ Testing Improvements
- 12/42 tests failing (integration tests need component updates)
- **Action:** Park until Sprint 05
- **Why:** Not blocking for Season 01 launch

### ⏸️ Content Expansion
- Level 2-3 lessons (intermediate tactics)
- Video explanations
- "Position of the Week" feature
- **Action:** Wait for Season 01 signal on what members actually want

## Parking Instructions (Until Jan 2, 2025)

### Week of Dec 9-15: Setup & Self-Playthrough

**Do:**
- [ ] Set up Discord server (30 min, follow DISCORD_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Create fresh Chessio account
- [ ] Complete Week 1 mission as a member
- [ ] Complete Week 2 mission as a member
- [ ] Try 1-2 Week 3 lessons
- [ ] Note friction in simple doc: "Pre-Season Notes (Dec 2024)"

**Don't:**
- ❌ Refactor lesson system
- ❌ Redesign UI
- ❌ Add new features
- ❌ Spend more than 2-3 hours total

**If you find a blocking bug:**
- Fix it if < 30 min
- Otherwise log to Sprint 05 backlog

**If you find minor UX issues:**
- Log to "Optional Pre-Season Fixes" in Atlas
- Don't fix unless it will genuinely block a beginner

### Week of Dec 16-22: Buffer Week
- Optional: Review docs one more time
- Otherwise: Don't think about Chessio

### Week of Dec 23-29: Holiday Break
- Completely off
- Enjoy the holidays
- Come back fresh

### Week of Dec 30 - Jan 1: Final Prep
- [ ] Review founding member list
- [ ] Customize DM templates for each person
- [ ] Prepare Discord posts
- [ ] Clear calendar for Jan 6-9

**Everything else is already done.**

---

## What Not to Touch

### 🔒 Locked Files (Don't Edit)
- All Season 01 docs (plan, messages, launch plan, debrief template)
- Discord setup guide
- Founder operating system
- Launch DM templates
- Founding members selection guide
- Club Architect prompt

**Why:** These are complete systems. Tweaking them now = overthinking.

### 🔒 Product Code (Minimal Changes Only)
- Only fix truly blocking bugs
- No feature additions
- No refactors
- No "improvements" that aren't critical

**Why:** You need Season 01 signal before building more.

---

## Mental Model: Chessio is "Baked"

Think of Season 01 like a cake in the oven:

- ✅ Recipe written (Season plan)
- ✅ Ingredients prepped (Product + docs)
- ✅ Cake in oven (Scheduled for Jan 6)
- ⏰ Timer set (Jan 2 invite window)

**Opening the oven door now = collapsed cake.**

Your job between now and Jan 2:
1. Light self-playthrough to catch obvious issues
2. Set up Discord
3. Pick founding members
4. Relax until launch window

**That's it.**

**Tell me which track you want to focus on, and we'll build the same level of clarity there.**

## What You've Built (Big Picture)

In the last few weeks, you've transformed Chessio from "nice app" into:

1. **A Product:** Polished v1.3-alpha with premium design
2. **A Program:** Structured 4-week learning journey
3. **A Community:** Discord-based international club
4. **An Operating System:** Sustainable founder routines
5. **A Learning Loop:** Debrief → Iterate → Improve

**This is not just an app. This is a complete micro-venture.**

You've front-loaded all the complexity into documentation, which means:
- You can step away without forgetting anything
- You can hand this to someone else and they'd know what to do
- You can execute with confidence when January arrives

**That's rare and valuable.**

---

## Final Note

**Chessio is ready. You are ready.**

Between now and January 2:
- Do the light self-playthrough
- Pick your founding members
- Set up Discord
- Then stop thinking about it

**The docs hold the complexity. You can relax.** 🥋♟️

When January 2 arrives, open SEASON_01_LAUNCH_PLAN.md and follow the steps.

**It's that simple.**
