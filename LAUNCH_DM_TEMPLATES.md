# Launch DM Template - Season 01 Invites

Copy-paste template for inviting founding members to Season 01.

---

## Option 1: Personal DM (Recommended)

Use this for people you know personally. Customize the [bracketed parts].

```
Hey [Name]!

I'm launching something I've been building for the last few months, and I'd love your help testing it.

It's called **Chessio** – a calm, beginner-friendly way to learn chess tactics and stop blundering so much.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**What it is:**
• A web app with short, guided chess lessons (~5 min each)
• Interactive board where you practice real positions
• Gamification: XP, levels, but zero pressure/streaks

**What I need from you:**
• ~20–30 minutes per week (spread across 2–3 sessions)
• Honest feedback on what's confusing or annoying
• Optional: Join a small Discord club where we follow weekly "missions" together

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**This is Alpha 1 + Season 01**, which means:
• You're one of the first 5–10 people trying this
• Rough edges are expected (that's what you're helping me find)
• Your feedback directly shapes what gets built next

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**If you're in:**

1. Create an account at: https://chessio.io
   (Any email works, no payment needed)

2. Join the club Discord: [Your Discord Invite Link]
   (Check #welcome-start-here for the vibe and structure)

3. Follow Week 1 mission in #announcements
   (Should take ~20 min, you'll complete a few intro lessons)

4. Share feedback as you go
   (Use the in-app feedback button or just message me)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Season 01 runs for 4 weeks starting [Start Date].**

No pressure to be perfect or finish everything. The goal is:
*"Can a complete beginner use this and feel less confused about chess?"*

Let me know if you're in! 🥋♟️

## Option 2: Short & Casual

Use this for quick messages or people you don't know as well.

```
Hey [Name]!

Quick ask: I built a chess learning app and I'm testing it with a small group. 

**Chessio** – calm, beginner-friendly chess training. Think "Duolingo for chess tactics".

Need ~20–30 min/week for 4 weeks. Honest feedback is the goal.

**Links:**
• App: https://chessio.io
• Club Discord: [Your Discord Invite Link]

Interested? 🥋♟️

## Option 3: Group Message (Discord/Slack/WhatsApp)

Use this if you're inviting a small group at once.

```
Hey everyone 👋

**Chessio – Calm Chess Training for Beginners**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**What I need:**
• 5–10 people to test it for 4 weeks
• ~20–30 min/week commitment (spread across 2–3 sessions)
• Honest feedback on what's confusing/annoying

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**This is Alpha 1 + Founding Season 01:**

• We'll follow weekly "missions" together in a small Discord club
• Your feedback shapes what gets built next

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**If you're interested:**

1. Sign up: https://chessio.io (any email, no payment)

Season starts [Start Date]. Let me know if you're in! 🥋♟️
```

## Option 4: Email (Formal)

Use this for professional contacts or email invites.

**Subject:** Inviting you to test Chessio Alpha (4-week commitment)

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I'm launching the first alpha test of Chessio – a calm, beginner-friendly chess learning platform I've been building.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Why I'm building it:**
Most chess resources are overwhelming, fast-paced, and assume you already know the jargon. Chessio is the opposite: calm, bite-sized lessons with clear explanations. Think "Duolingo for chess tactics".

**What I need from you:**
• Test the app for 4 weeks (Season 01)
• ~20–30 minutes per week (spread across 2–3 sessions)
• Join a small Discord club where we follow weekly "missions"
• Provide honest feedback on what works and what's confusing

**What you get:**
• Early access to the full platform (no payment, no ads)
• A structured 4-week learning path from "I blunder constantly" → "I can spot basic tactics"
• A small, supportive community of other beginners

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Details:**
• Start Date: [Start Date]
• Duration: 4 weeks
• Platform: https://chessio.io (web app, works on any device)
• Community: Discord (link below)

**This is Alpha 1**, so rough edges are expected. You're helping shape what gets built next.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**To join:**

1. Create an account at https://chessio.io
2. Join the Discord: [Your Discord Invite Link]
3. Check #welcome-start-here for the structure
4. Follow Week 1 mission in #announcements

Reply to this email or DM me if you have questions!

Looking forward to your feedback.

— Mahmood

P.S. If this doesn't fit your schedule right now, no worries at all. I'll run Season 02 in a few months if you want to join then.

## Who to Invite: Selection Criteria

**Ideal founding members:**

✅ **Skill Level:**
- True beginners (know how pieces move, that's it)
- Rusty players (played as a kid, forgot everything)
- Casual players (play occasionally, blunder a lot)

✅ **Personality:**
- Curious about learning
- Not overly demanding
- Will give honest feedback (not just praise)
- Comfortable saying "this is confusing"

✅ **Availability:**
- Can commit to 20–30 min/week for 4 weeks
- Active enough to check Discord 1–2x per week
- Won't disappear without saying why

❌ **Avoid:**
- People who are already strong players (not your target user)
- People who want to "help you build features" (feedback is enough)
- People who will be offended by rough edges
- People who expect 24/7 support

**Diversity matters:**
- Mix of age groups (if possible)
- Mix of timezones (tests async club model)
- Mix of learning styles (visual, analytical, etc.)

## Timing Strategy

### Recommended: Monday Start

**Why Monday:**
- Clear start of the week = easy to remember
- People have energy after the weekend
- Weekly mission cadence aligns with calendar weeks

**Sample Timeline:**

**Saturday (2 days before):**
- Send all invites
- Give people weekend to create account + join Discord
- Post welcome message in #welcome-start-here

**Sunday (1 day before):**
- Check who joined Discord
- Welcome them in #club-chat
- Remind them: "Mission starts tomorrow!"

**Monday (Day 1):**
- Post Season 01 announcement in #announcements
- Post Week 1 mission right after
- Drop nudge in #club-chat

### Alternative: Weekend Start

If your members are busy weekdays:

**Friday evening:**
- Send invites
- Post Season announcement

**Saturday morning:**
- Post Week 1 mission
- People have weekend to start

**Adjust weekly cadence to Friday missions instead of Monday**

---

## Example: December 2025 Launch

**Timeline:**

- **Saturday, Dec 7:** Send invites to 5–10 people
- **Sunday, Dec 8:** Check-ins, welcome messages
- **Monday, Dec 9:** Launch Season 01 (Week 1 mission)
- **Wednesday, Dec 11:** Mid-week check-in
- **Sunday, Dec 15:** Week 1 wrap

- **Monday, Dec 16:** Week 2 mission
- **Monday, Dec 23:** Week 3 mission (note: holiday week)
- **Monday, Dec 30:** Week 4 mission (note: New Year's)

**Warning:** If launching in late December, consider the holidays. People might be traveling or distracted. Alternative: Launch early January for better engagement.

## Follow-Up Messages

### If Someone Joins But Doesn't Start

Wait 2–3 days, then send:

```
Hey [Name]!

Saw you joined the Discord – welcome! 🎉

Just checking: did you get a chance to create a Chessio account and try the Week 1 mission?

If you're stuck or confused about anything, let me know. No pressure if timing doesn't work – just wanted to check in.
```

### If Someone Gives Feedback

Always respond with:

```
This is super helpful, thank you!

[Address their specific point]

Keep the feedback coming – this is exactly what I need to hear.
```

### If Someone Completes Week 1 Fast

Celebrate it:

```
Nice! You crushed Week 1. 🥋

Feel free to keep going at your own pace, or hang out and share what you learned in #wins-and-reflections.

Week 2 mission drops Monday if you want to sync up with the group.
```

## Tracking Your Invites

Keep a simple list (spreadsheet, note file, whatever):

| Name | Invite Sent | Joined Discord | Started App | Week 1 Done | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Alice | Dec 7 | Dec 7 | Dec 9 | Dec 10 | Great feedback on Task 3 |
| Bob | Dec 7 | Dec 8 | Not yet | - | Busy with work, might join late |
| Carol | Dec 7 | Not yet | - | - | Follow up on Dec 9 |

**Don't obsess over this.** Just helps you remember who to check in with.

---

## Final Pre-Launch Checklist

Before sending any invites, verify:

- [ ] Discord server is set up (all channels, welcome message posted)
- [ ] Season 01 announcement is posted in #announcements
- [ ] Week 1 mission is posted in #announcements
- [ ] Discord invite link is generated (set to 20 max uses, no expiration)
- [ ] Chessio app is live at https://chessio.io
- [ ] You've tested the full Week 1 flow yourself (create account → complete lessons → reach Pawn level)
- [ ] You have 5–10 specific people in mind to invite
- [ ] You've picked a start date (and it's not during major holidays)
- [ ] You've cleared your calendar for the 4-week commitment (daily 5-min checks, weekly 30-min admin)

**When all checked, copy a DM template and send your first invite.** 🚀

---

## Remember

**You only need 5 people to make Season 01 valuable.**

If 10 people say yes but only 5 show up, that's still a win.  
If 3 people complete all 4 weeks and give great feedback, that's a massive win.

Don't aim for scale. Aim for **signal**.

Good luck, Mahmood. 🥋♟️
