## Step 4: Post Welcome Message

In **#welcome-start-here**, pin this message:

```
Welcome to the **Chessio International Club – Founding Season 01** 🥋♟️

This is a calm, beginner-friendly chess club for adults and serious beginners.

You don't need to be "good" at chess to be here.
If you know how the pieces move and you blunder a lot – you're in the right place.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**What we'll do (4 weeks):**
• Use the Chessio app (https://chessio.io) as our training ground
• Follow 1 small "mission" per week (a few lessons + puzzles)
• Share 1 position or reflection each week in the chat

**Time commitment:**
2–3 short sessions per week (20–30 minutes each). No streaks. No guilt.

**Vibe rules:**
• Be kind to yourself and others
• No bragging, no shaming, no "just don't blunder" comments
• Questions are always welcome – even "basic" ones

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**When you're ready:**
1. Create an account at https://chessio.io
2. Say hi in <#club-chat> – tell us your chess story in 1–2 sentences
3. Check <#announcements> for the Season 01 mission and get started

Welcome to the club. 🥋♟️
```

---

## Step 5: Post Season Announcement

In **#announcements**, post these two messages:

### Message 1: Season Kickoff

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🥋 **Founding Season 01 is live!** ♟️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For the next 4 weeks, we're running Season 01 of the Chessio International Club.

**Season Theme:**
From "I blunder all the time" → "I can stay safe and spot simple tactics"

**Weekly Plan:**
• Week 1 – Safety & Basic Habits
• Week 2 – Stop Hanging Pieces
• Week 3 – Tactics Starter Pack (forks, pins)
• Week 4 – Basic Checkmates & Reflection

You don't have to be perfect or follow every mission exactly.
The goal is: **small, calm steps forward.**

👉 Next message: Week 1 mission
```

### Message 2: Week 1 Mission

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Week 1 Mission – "Safety & Basic Habits"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Welcome to Week 1, everyone.

This week is about getting comfortable with Chessio and building safe opening habits.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 **YOUR MISSION THIS WEEK**

In the Chessio app:

1. Complete all Level 0 lessons
   (piece moves, basic rules, check vs checkmate)

2. Start Level 1:
   • "Safe Development" intro
   • "Piece Values" recap

**Goal:** Reach Pawn level (75 XP) or get close

**Time:** 2–3 sessions of 20–30 minutes each

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💬 **SHARE WITH THE GROUP**

Once you've done a few lessons, share in <#wins-and-reflections>:

*"One thing I thought I knew but realized I didn't"*

Examples:
• "I didn't know stalemate was a draw"
• "I didn't realize you can't castle through check"
• "I thought knights could move 2 squares in any direction"

This helps everyone learn from each other's "aha" moments.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ **QUESTIONS?**

Just ask in <#club-chat>. No question is too basic – that's exactly what we're here for.

Let's build some solid foundations. 🥋♟️
```

Pin both messages in #announcements.

---

## Step 6: Post First Chat Nudge

In **#club-chat**, post:

```
Welcome everyone 👋

When you see this, drop a quick message:

• Where you're from 🌍
• How long you've been around chess (even if it was only as a kid)
• One thing you struggle with right now (e.g., "I hang pieces", "I miss tactics", "Openings confuse me")

No pressure to be fancy. One or two sentences is enough.

Then, when you have 20 minutes:
• Log into https://chessio.io
• Complete the **Week 1 mission** in <#announcements>
• Share anything that surprised you in <#wins-and-reflections>
```

---

## Step 7: Generate Invite Link

1. Go to Server Settings → Invites
2. Create a new invite:
   - **Expire after:** Never (or 7 days for security)
   - **Max number of uses:** 20 (for first wave)
   - **Grant temporary membership:** No
3. Copy the invite link

---

## Step 8: Send Invites

Use the alpha invite from `ALPHA_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, but add the Discord link at the top:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 You're Invited to Test Chessio Alpha
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hey!

You're getting early access to Chessio – a calm, confidence-building way to learn chess.

This is Alpha 1 + Founding Season 01, which means you'll be part of a small group testing both the app AND the club structure.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔗 **Access:**
- App: https://chessio.io
- Club: [Your Discord Invite Link]

📧 Create an account with any email
⏱️  Time needed: ~20–30 minutes per week (spread across 2–3 sessions)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Rest of alpha invite from ALPHA_TESTING_GUIDE.md]
```

Send to 5–10 people you trust to give honest feedback.

---

## Step 9: Weekly Maintenance

### Every Monday:
1. Post next week's mission in #announcements (from SEASON_01_MESSAGES.md)
2. Pin the new mission
3. Unpin the previous week's mission (keep it visible but not pinned)

### Mid-Week (Wednesday/Thursday):
1. Post a check-in in #club-chat:
   ```
   🔔 Mid-Week Check-In
   
   How's the mission going?
   
   Quick poll (just reply with emoji):
   ✅ – On track, feeling good
   🤔 – Struggling a bit but pushing through
   ❌ – Stuck or confused about something
   
   If you're stuck, tell me where. That's the useful feedback.
   ```

### Weekend:
1. Engage with any posts in #positions-and-puzzles
2. Celebrate wins in #wins-and-reflections
3. Answer questions in #club-chat

---

## Moderation Tips

**Keep it Calm:**
- React to posts with 🥋 ♟️ 🎉 emojis
- Thank people for sharing struggles (not just successes)
- When someone posts a mistake, respond: "Great awareness! That's exactly what we're training."

**Handle Questions:**
- Never say "just don't blunder"
- Prefer: "Here's what I'd look for before moving..."
- Encourage peer help, but step in if answers get technical

**Manage Expectations:**
- Remind people: "This is alpha, rough edges are expected"
- If someone struggles: "Season 01 is about finding what works, not being perfect"

---

## Success Signals (First Week)

You'll know Week 1 is working if:
- ✅ 5+ people join the Discord
- ✅ 3+ people share introductions in #club-chat
- ✅ 2+ people post in #wins-and-reflections
- ✅ At least 1 question gets asked in #club-chat

If any of these don't happen, it's a signal to reach out directly and ask what's blocking them.

---

## Next Steps After Week 1

1. **Consolidate feedback** (what worked / didn't work)
2. **Track metrics** against ALPHA_SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md
3. **Adjust Week 2** if needed based on actual engagement
4. **Document learnings** for Season 02 planning

---

## Emergency Procedures

**If Discord becomes too noisy:**
- Create a #quiet-zone channel for focused discussion
- Use threads more aggressively

**If people drop off:**
- Send a DM: "Hey, noticed you've been quiet. Everything okay? Any blockers?"
- Don't guilt-trip, just check in

**If someone asks about paid features:**
- "Right now we're focused on making the core experience great. Pricing comes later."

**If technical issues arise:**
- Direct them to use in-app feedback button
- Log the issue in a private #founder-notes channel (for your eyes only)
