# Alpha 1 – Success Criteria

Clear definition of "Alpha 1 went well" for first wave testing (5–10 testers).

---

## A. Quantitative Targets

### ✅ Activation
- **≥ 80%** create an account and complete **at least 1 lesson**

### ✅ Return
- **≥ 50%** come back for **at least 1 second session** (new day or simulated)

### ✅ Progress
- **≥ 3 people** reach **Pawn** level
- **≥ 1 person** reaches **Knight or Bishop** level

### ✅ Feedback Volume
- **≥ 5 feedback** submissions via in-app form
- At least **3 of them** with **clear, actionable points** (not just "cool app")

---

## B. Qualitative Signals

### ✅ Clarity & Navigation
Multiple people say they **understood what to do next** most of the time:
- "The Today's Goal thing helped"
- "It was obvious where to continue"

### ✅ Brand Resonance
At least one person explicitly mentions:
- They **liked** the calm vibe / non-hype feel, OR
- The app felt **non-intimidating** as a beginner

### ✅ No Hard Blockers
No one reports critical issues:
- "I couldn't log in"
- "The board didn't load"
- "I kept hitting an error on X page"

### 🎯 Bonus – Detailed Critique
Ideally we get:
- **1–2 testers** giving **detailed critique** of specific lessons or puzzles
  - "This one was too hard / too easy / unclear"
  - This level of engagement signals genuine interest

## What's Next?

If Alpha 1 meets these criteria:
→ **Sprint 05: Alpha Fix & Polish**
- Address top 3–5 feedback themes
- Fix any UX friction points
- Prepare for wider alpha (20–30 testers)

If Alpha 1 falls short:
→ **Focus on the gaps:**
- Low activation? Revisit onboarding
- Low return? Improve "Today's Goal"
- No feedback? Clarify feedback prompts
- Hard blockers? Fix immediately, re-test

## Success = Learning

Remember: Alpha 1 is about **learning what works** and **what doesn't**.

Honest negative feedback is just as valuable as positive feedback. The goal is to find and fix issues *before* wider launch.
