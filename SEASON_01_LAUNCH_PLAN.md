Everything else is bonus.

## Emergency Escape Hatch

**If you need to postpone after invites are sent:**

Post in Discord #club-chat:
```
Hey everyone – quick change of plans.

I need to push Season 01 start by one week to [new date].

[Brief, honest reason: "Holiday travel ran long" / "Need to fix a bug first" / etc.]

The extra week means we'll have an even smoother experience.
Same structure, same missions, just shifted by 7 days.

Sorry for the change – see you on [new date]! 🥋
```

People will understand. Better to delay than to launch stressed.

---

## Next Action (Right Now)

**Do this today:**

1. Open your calendar
2. Block Jan 6 - Feb 2 as "Season 01 Active"
3. Add the recurring blocks listed above
4. Create a note file: "SEASON_01_FOUNDING_MEMBERS.md"
5. List 5-10 specific people you'll invite

**Then relax until Dec 9.** You have time.

## The 4-Week Journey Visual

```
Week 1 (Jan 6-12): Safety & Basic Habits → Pawn (75 XP)
Week 2 (Jan 13-19): Stop Hanging Pieces → ~140-160 XP
Week 3 (Jan 20-26): Tactics Starter Pack → Knight (200+ XP)
Week 4 (Jan 27-Feb 2): Basic Checkmates → Bishop (375+ XP)
```

**4 Mondays. 4 missions. 4 weeks of calm progress.**

That's the whole Season 01. 🥋♟️
