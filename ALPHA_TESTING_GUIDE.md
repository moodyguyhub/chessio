# How to Test Chessio

Thank you for helping test Chessio! You don't have to be "good" at chess to help. Just follow these steps and tell me how it felt.

**Time commitment:** ~20–30 minutes total

---

## 1️⃣ First Visit – Explore the Basics (10–15 min)

1. Go to **https://chessio.io** and create an account.
2. On the dashboard, check what it tells you:
   - Does the **welcome message** make sense?
   - Does the **"Today's Goal"** card feel clear?
3. Start with the suggested lesson:
   - Play through **2–4 lessons** (you can just follow the instructions).
   - Finish at least **one puzzle set** if you can.

### What to Pay Attention To:

- Anything that feels confusing or annoying
- Any moment where you didn't know **what to click next**
- Any place where the text feels too technical or too childish

**If something feels off, don't push through silently** – that's the stuff we want to hear.

## 2️⃣ Second Visit – "Welcome Back" (5–10 min)

Either come back the **next day**, or later the same day:

1. Log in again and land on the dashboard.
2. Notice:
   - How does the **"Welcome back"** message feel?
   - Does **"Today's Goal"** now suggest something that makes sense, based on what you did before?
3. Try completing one more lesson or puzzle from the Today's Goal.

## 3️⃣ Sending Feedback (2–5 min)

From inside Chessio:

1. Use the **Feedback** button (from the alpha banner or header).
2. In your message, it really helps if you include:
   - Where you were (e.g. "Dashboard", "Forks lesson", "Puzzle pack")
   - What you *expected* to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Anything you liked or disliked

**Honest and messy is fine** – this is early alpha.

## 4️⃣ Optional – Try to "Level Up"

If you feel like playing more:

- See how far you can get in **XP / Levels**:
  - Did you notice when you levelled up (Novice → Pawn → Knight → Bishop)?
  - Did it feel satisfying or barely noticeable?

Report anything that felt like:

- "Oh this is cool"
- "This is boring / slow"
- "I'm lost, what do I do now?"

That's exactly the data we need.

## Thank You! 🙏

Your honest feedback helps us make Chessio better. Every piece of feedback – even "this confused me" – is incredibly valuable at this stage.
