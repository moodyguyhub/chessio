## Sprint 05 Priorities

**Based on Season 01 learnings, what MUST get fixed/improved?**

**Top 3 Critical Fixes:**
1. [e.g., "Fix Task 3 valid moves logic – blocked 3 people"]

## Season 02 Design

**Should we run Season 02? When? What changes?**

### Decision: [Yes / No / Wait]

**If Yes:**
**Start Date:** [e.g., "March 3, 2025 – give 4 weeks for Sprint 05 fixes"]

**Structure Changes:**
- [e.g., "Keep 4-week format, adjust Week 2 difficulty"]
- [e.g., "Add optional 'advanced track' for people who finish early"]
- [e.g., "Introduce 'Position of the Week' community feature"]

**Mission Adjustments:**
- Week 1: [Keep same / Adjust: ...]
- Week 2: [Keep same / Adjust: ...]
- Week 3: [Keep same / Adjust: ...]
- Week 4: [Keep same / Adjust: ...]

**Community Changes:**
- [e.g., "Add #position-of-the-week channel"]
- [e.g., "Simplify to 3 channels instead of 5"]
- [e.g., "Try Monday + Friday missions instead of just Monday"]

**Cohort Size:**
- Target: [X] members
- Invite strategy: [Founding members can invite +1 / Fresh cohort / Mix]

**If No / Wait:**
**Reason:**
- [e.g., "Need more time to implement Sprint 05 fixes"]
- [e.g., "Founder needs a break before committing to another season"]
- [e.g., "Want to pivot to different format (self-paced vs cohort-based)"]

**Next Steps:**
- [e.g., "Run 2 more alpha waves (smaller, 1-week tests)"]
- [e.g., "Shift to open beta with self-paced learning"]
- [e.g., "Focus on B2B (chess clubs/schools) instead of individual learners"]

## Final Note

**Season 01 was an experiment.** 

The goal wasn't perfection – it was **signal**.

If you learned what works, what doesn't, and what to build next, it was a success.

If 3-5 people felt like they improved at chess and enjoyed the journey, it was a massive success.

**Thank your founding members. Take a week off. Then decide what's next.** 🥋♟️
