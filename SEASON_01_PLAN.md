## Notes for Future Seasons

**What to Track:**
- Which lessons/puzzles members skip or struggle with
- Drop-off points (week-by-week retention)
- Feedback themes about difficulty, pacing, content gaps

**Season 02 Ideas:**
- More advanced tactics (discovered attacks, removal of defender)
- Endgame basics (king + pawn, opposition)
- Opening principles (not opening theory, just "develop, castle, connect rooks")

**Scalability:**
- Season 01 is designed for 5–20 members
- For 20+, consider breaking into cohorts starting same day
- For 50+, consider staggered start dates or separate channels per cohort
