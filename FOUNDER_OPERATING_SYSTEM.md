# Founder Operating System - Season 01

Your lightweight personal routine for running Chessio International Club without burning out.

---

## Philosophy

**You are not customer support.**  
You are the founder running an experiment with a small group of trusted humans.

**Good enough > Perfect.**  
Respond to what matters. Let some things sit. Season 01 is about learning, not perfection.

**Calm compound > Frantic energy.**  
5 minutes daily beats 2-hour binges on Sunday.

---

## Daily Routine (5–10 minutes)

### Morning Check (5 min)

Open Discord **once**:

1. **Scan these channels:**
   - `#club-chat` - Any blocking questions?
   - `#wins-and-reflections` - Any wins to celebrate?

2. **Take these actions only:**
   - React with 1–2 emojis (🥋, ♟️, 🎉, ✨) on wins
   - Answer questions that are **truly blocking** someone
   - Let conversational stuff flow without you

3. **Don't do this:**
   - Don't reply to every message
   - Don't try to be "present" all day
   - Don't doom-scroll for engagement

### Evening Check (2 min)

Open Chessio admin dashboard:

1. **Check in-app feedback (if any)**
   - Read the message
   - If it's minor: just note it mentally
   - If it's big/recurring: log to Atlas in one sentence:
     ```
     Feedback log – S01D3: 2 users confused about valid moves on Task 3
     ```

2. **That's it.**  
   No need to respond immediately unless it's breaking the app.

---

## Weekly Routine (20–30 minutes)

### Monday Morning - "Mission Day" (10 min)

1. **Post Weekly Mission**
   - Go to `#announcements`
   - Copy-paste from `SEASON_01_MESSAGES.md`
   - Pin the new message
   - Unpin last week's mission (keep visible but not pinned)

2. **Drop Nudge in #club-chat**
   ```
   New mission is up in #announcements 👀
   
   If you only do ONE thing this week, do this mission.
   
   20–30 minutes total, spread across a few sessions.
   ```

3. **Update Your Personal Tracker**
   - Open a simple note file (or Atlas):
   ```
   Season 01 - Week [X]
   Mission: [Name]
   Started: [Date]
   Notes: [Leave blank for now]
   ```

### Wednesday/Thursday - "Mid-Week Check" (5 min)

Post the check-in template in `#club-chat`:

```
🔔 Mid-Week Check-In

How's the mission going?

Quick poll (just reply with emoji):
✅ – On track, feeling good
🤔 – Struggling a bit but pushing through
❌ – Stuck or confused about something

If you're stuck, tell me where. That's the useful feedback.
```

Watch responses. If 2+ people mention the same issue, that's signal.

### Sunday Evening - "Week Wrap" (15 min)

1. **Review the week**
   - How many people seemed active? (just a rough count)
   - Any recurring confusion themes?
   - Any cool improvement stories shared?

2. **Write one paragraph in Atlas/NotebookLM:**
   ```
   Season 01 - Week [X] Wrap
   
   Active: ~[X] people posted or reacted this week
   
   Confusion: [Theme, e.g., "Several people confused about forks vs pins"]
   
   Wins: [1-2 quotes from #wins-and-reflections]
   
   Notes for Sprint 05: [What to fix/improve]
   ```

3. **That's it.**  
   This becomes your Season 01 debrief data for planning Sprint 05.

## Launch Strategy: Soft & Controlled

### Phase 1: First Wave (Week 1)

**Who to invite:**
- 5–10 people you personally know
- People who are:
  - Curious about chess/learning
  - Not super demanding
  - Will give honest feedback (not just praise)
  - Represent diverse skill levels (true beginners → rusty players)

**What to send:**
- One DM with:
  - Chessio app link (https://chessio.io)
  - Discord invite link
  - Short context (alpha + Season 01)
  - Clear expectations (experiment, 20-30 min/week, honest feedback)

**When to send:**
- Pick a **Monday** as "Season 01 Day 1"
- Send invites **2 days before** (Saturday) so people can join over the weekend
- Example: If Season starts Monday Dec 9, send invites Saturday Dec 7

### Phase 2: Mid-Season (Optional)

**If first wave goes well:**
- Add 5–10 more people in Week 2 or 3
- Same criteria: trusted, diverse skill levels
- Tell them: "You're joining mid-season, catch up at your own pace"

**If first wave struggles:**
- Pause invites
- Fix what's broken
- Resume in Season 02

### Phase 3: Season 02

**Based on Season 01 learnings:**
- Adjust missions/timing
- Improve confusing lessons
- Add features from feedback
- Scale to 20–30 members if sustainable

## What to Watch (Without Obsessing)

You don't need Perfect Analytics™. Just watch these 4 signals:

### 1. **Showing Up**
**Signal:** A few messages per week in Discord  
**Good:** 3+ people posting in #club-chat or #wins-and-reflections  
**Concerning:** Total silence for 3+ days  
**Action if concerning:** Post a gentle nudge: "Anyone trying the mission? Share your progress!"

### 2. **Getting Stuck**
**Signal:** Same question/confusion appearing multiple times  
**Good:** Different people asking different questions  
**Concerning:** 3+ people confused about the same thing  
**Action if concerning:** 
- Answer publicly in #club-chat
- Log to Atlas: "Common blocker – [issue]"
- Flag for Sprint 05

### 3. **Feeling Pressured**
**Signal:** Messages with guilt/shame language  
**Good:** "I only did 2 lessons this week but learned X"  
**Concerning:** "Sorry I'm behind, I'm terrible at this"  
**Action if concerning:**
- Reply publicly: "No apologies needed! Season 01 is about finding what works, not being perfect."
- Soften copy in next week's mission
- Check your own language – are you accidentally adding pressure?

### 4. **Feeling Progress**
**Signal:** People sharing wins, no matter how small  
**Good:** "I finally spotted a fork before moving!" or "I reached Pawn level!"  
**Concerning:** No one sharing any wins after 2 weeks  
**Action if concerning:**
- Post in #club-chat: "What's ONE thing you learned this week, even if it's tiny?"
- Celebrate the smallest wins yourself: "Someone just told me they learned what a pin is – that's the stuff 🥋"

---

## Success Criteria for Season 01

**Season 01 is a WIN if:**

✅ 5+ people join the Discord  
✅ 3+ people actively participate (post/react) each week  
✅ 2+ people reach Pawn level (75 XP)  
✅ 1+ person reaches Knight level (200 XP)  
✅ At least 5 pieces of useful feedback collected  
✅ No one reports feeling shamed or pressured  
✅ You (Mahmood) don't burn out maintaining it  

**Everything else is bonus.**

## Emergency Procedures

### If Discord Gets Too Noisy
- Create `#quiet-zone` channel for focused discussion
- Use threads more aggressively
- Set #club-chat to "slow mode" (1 message per 30 seconds)

### If People Drop Off Completely
- Send a **private DM** (not public guilt):
  ```
  Hey! Noticed you've been quiet in the club. Everything okay?
  
  No pressure at all – just checking if there are any blockers
  or if Season 01 timing just doesn't work right now.
  ```
- Don't guilt-trip. Just check in.
- If they say "too busy" → totally fine, invite them to Season 02

### If Someone Asks About Paid Features
- Response template:
  ```
  Right now we're focused on making the core experience great.
  
  Pricing will come later – for Season 01, everything is free
  and your feedback is the most valuable thing.
  ```

### If Technical Bug Blocks Progress
- Ask them to use in-app feedback button
- Log the issue in a private `#founder-notes` channel (your eyes only)
- If it's critical: fix immediately
- If it's minor: log for Sprint 05

### If You're Overwhelmed
- **Cut daily Discord checks to every other day**
- Post in #club-chat:
  ```
  Hey everyone – taking a breather for 2 days.
  
  Keep going with the missions, help each other out,
  and I'll be back [day] to catch up.
  ```
- Members will understand. Founder burnout helps no one.

## Energy Management

### Signs You're Doing It Right
- You check Discord once/day without anxiety
- You can skip a day without guilt
- You're excited (not stressed) on Mission Day
- You're learning interesting things about how people learn chess

### Signs You're Overdoing It
- Checking Discord every hour
- Feeling guilty when not "engaging"
- Trying to reply to every message
- Staying up late to "monitor" the club

**If you notice overdoing signs:**
1. Set Discord to "Do Not Disturb" except during your scheduled check times
2. Remove Discord from your phone (desktop only)
3. Remind yourself: "Season 01 is an experiment, not a commitment to 24/7 support"

---

## Post-Season 01 Debrief

After Week 4, spend 30–60 minutes writing:

### 1. What Worked
- Which missions got the most engagement?
- What messaging resonated?
- What Discord channels were most active?

### 2. What Didn't Work
- Where did people get confused?
- Which missions were too easy/hard?
- What questions came up repeatedly?

### 3. Sprint 05 Priorities
- Based on feedback, what are the top 3 fixes?
- What's nice-to-have but not critical?

### 4. Season 02 Design
- Should we run it again? (yes/no/wait)
- What adjustments to missions/timing?
- Scale to more members or keep small?

## Remember

You're running a **calm chess club**, not a 24/7 support desk.

Season 01 is about:
- Testing the structure
- Learning what resonates
- Building with 5–10 trusted humans
- Keeping it sustainable for you

If you burn out in Week 2, there's no Season 02.

**Pace yourself. This is a long game.** 🥋♟️
